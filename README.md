# team-profile-generator
 Team profile generator is an application that uses Jest and Inquirer along with Node.js to test classes for Managers, Engineers, and Interns in a company and displays inputed information onto an HTML file.
 
 ## Installation
 This application used Jest as well as Inquirer and Node.js to accomplish its tasks.
 Node.js: npm init
 Inquirer: npm install inquirer
 Jest: npm install --save-dev jest
 
 ## Usage
 When the program is run it will ask the user to input information about the manager, and then ask if there are any other team members associated with the team such as Engineers and Interns. The program will stop asking for team members when the 'N/A' option has been selected and then will create and HTML page with the associated data.
